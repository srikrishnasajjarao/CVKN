Neural networks process data through:

- Compression: **Each layer filters out irrelevant details and reduces dimensionality**, identifying edges, corners, and textures in images to simplify raw pixel data.
- Deeper layers: Combine simpler features into high-level representations, progressing from edges to shapes to objects.
- Ability to generalize.
